# vircadia-mongodb
Vircadia Metaverse Server requires mongodb setting. However it is not an easy task to do. In order to automate this process, use `docker` and `docker-compose` with vircadia-domain-server-docker. Consult https://github.com/hasbegun/vircadia-domain-server-docker or https://github.com/vircadia/vircadia-domain-server-docker.

## Build.
Run ```build-mongo.sh``` This will create an `vircadia-mongodb` docker image.
You can run `run-mongo.sh` to see how it is running.
